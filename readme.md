# Vue.JS Nested Components

This is an example of some nesting I used for an application in Vue.JS.

This on its own is not intended to work, but rather be used as a part of a larger project such as a Laravel or Rails application.

The Vues that belong to certain routes will be in the folder marking the route as the directory name.

This project implements
- Nested components
- State management with Vuex
- Creating Sort orders on the fly in the view
- Handling complex sort orders once stored in the API

This is a work in progress, there's still more that needs to be done to get this as a stand-alone application.

### Todo
- write documentation on the data coming in
- Mock data coming in
- Have this as working standalone application
